/*
MergeSort Algorithm:

1- Divide: Divide the unsorted array into two halves. This can be done by finding the middle index of the array.

2- Conquer: Recursively sort the two halves of the array until they become single elements or empty arrays.

3- Merge: Merge the two sorted halves back together into a single sorted array. This can be done by comparing the elements from each half and inserting them into a new array in the correct order.
